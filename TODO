* 1.0 series
------------
Bugs:  
  book dropdown on 10:00-16:00/6 includes times that would overlap bookings

* 1.2 series
------------
Code documentation:
  real phpdoc format and publish 
Features:
  * heirarchical+fine-grained permission system 
  * longer bookings
  * IE5Mac compatability?
  * groups of instruments
  * internationalisation
  * bring email templates into the database

* Later
------------
  * in-place booking (js mouse commands, DOM+js/ajax?)
  

  
  
  

* a much more sophisticated permissions system that gives fine grained
 control over what users can do
 
* being able to set permissions on groups of instruments and groups of
 users 
 
* more reporting functions: future bookings by a user or group

* group of instruments:
  - calendar displays.
  - permissions
  - billing reports

* book instruments for weeks/months.

* instruments
  - does not apply timeslot rule on create?  
  
* confirmation
  - require confirmation for some instruments?


 * full, user-configurable billing support included
 * can export invoices or statements of usage
 * can email invoices or statements of usage to groups
 * unbooking an instrument causes an email to be sent to admin for some timeslots
 * unbooking an instrument causes an email to be sent to the unbook list for some timeslots

* -ve consumable quantities (for returns)?

* email users with notification of booking 
* email users a reminder that bookings are coming up (cron job)

* billing

configure exporttypes from files?

* data exports
  - summary of bookings for each user
  - summary of bookings for a set of instruments 

* instruments
  - can we put some better validation on the timeslotrule input? e.g. making sure every hour is accounted for?
  
* installer
  - create bumblebee.ini file?
  - can only run once? delete itself?
  - actually do the sql stuff?

* ini file
  - move bumblebee.ini to a db table? 

* USER TESTING
  - Firefox
  - IE6
  - Konq
  - IE5.5
  - IE5
  - Safari
  - Netscape 7 OSX



create a real db with no bogus booking data and no dodgy invalid users etc
-> sf.net 


document radius install and config

* theme
  - design new theme, bg etc (not NANO, PFPC, UoM)
  - clean up CSS, images etc for theme
  - icon location, also for export

* clean up action functions.
  - should groups, projects, users actions etc be invocations of the *same* obj?



->layout switch? use as call back function?

radiolist always returns ischanged on update()

make sure large data structures are being passed by reference not value
(speed up)

reflect postdata in case of re-login
 - when do sessions die?

$string = strip_tags($string, '<a><b><i><u>')
also do this in qw? $string = strip_tags($string, '')


$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']

check for noise in error logs


permit deletion of instrument classes


streamline creation of project with only one group
streamline creation of project when creating a user
(projects: create new as option and if set to create new then make one and send the projectid to "edit project")

??  work out confirmation emails and when adminconfirm is necessary

select all/deselect all javascript buttons where applicable



* unbook emails

delete references to groups, projects in billing info, userprojects etc
-- should there be checks for this? cannot delete things if used elsewhere?



Billing SQL notes:

for billing analysis, write a smart parser that scans the template for keys to write the SQL. May need to do some clever parsing too.




install?
-----------
<?
$dbhost = "localhost";    
$dbusername = "root";     
$dbpass = "";    
$dbname    = "dbname";     
$connection = mysql_connect($dbhost, $dbusername, $dbpass);
$SelectedDB = mysql_select_db($dbname);
$filename = "createdb.sql";
$fd = fopen ($filename, "r");
$contents = fread ($fd, filesize ($filename));
fclose ($fd);
mysql_query ("$contents");
?>






flat file logging?

<?php
    $agent = $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
    $uri = $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'];
    $user = $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'];
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
    $ref = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];
    $dtime = date('r');
    
    if($ref == ""){
        $ref = "None";
    }
    if($user == ""){
        $user = "None";
    }
    
    $entry_line = "$dtime - IP: $ip | Agent: $agent  | URL: $uri | Referrer: $ref | Username: $user n";
    $fp = fopen("logs.txt", "a");
    fputs($fp, $entry_line);
    fclose($fp);
?>
